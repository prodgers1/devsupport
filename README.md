# DevSupport

## Description:

This project is a collection of tools used frequently by me in my day to day work. There were many times I needed to encode or decode data that included sensitive data, and by pasting that into random websites, I couldn't be sure what they were doing with my data.

I am providing all the code to this project to show I am not saving any user's data. All of it stays in the browser so there is no fear when using these tools with sensitive data.

## Technology:

I recently learned about [Remix](https://remix.run/docs), and built this while learning how this framework works. Although this site doesn't utilize a lot of Remix's capabilities, it forced me to read through their docs to gain an understanding of how things are working under the hood.

# Where can I find it?

# Development

I plan to add various tools here as I see fit so I don't need to jump around to various websites to accomplish my tasks. I hope to make this the one stop for all common tools used in development.
